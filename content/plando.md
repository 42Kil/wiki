title: Plandomizer
---

A plandomizer (often shortened as plando) is a special kind of seed where another person already placed every items manually. These seeds can be anything from showcase of what the header's language can let you do or custom challenges.

You need to launch them through the randomizer in order to play them. Plandos are created by using a custom programming language which you can learn by reading through the [Header Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IR1DHnbtO8rydCLEgFh-yp3iRkzZbFAG-EmR5hxrfmU/edit).

Here is a list of every available Plando. You can contact the plando's creator if there is no direct link to them and you want to play them :
