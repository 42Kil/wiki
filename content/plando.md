A plandomizer (often shortened as plando) is a special kind of seed where another person chose the item placement. These seeds can be showcase of what the header's language can let you do or custom challenges. You need to launch them through the randomizer in order to play them. Plandos are created by using a custom programation language which you can learn by reading through the [Header Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IR1DHnbtO8rydCLEgFh-yp3iRkzZbFAG-EmR5hxrfmU/edit).
