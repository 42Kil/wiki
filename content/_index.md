Welcome to the Ori and the Will of the Wisps randomizer wiki!

This is a mod for the PC version of Ori and the Will of the Wisps which changes the contents of pickups. So when playing
the randomizer you will probably find skills when picking up a spirit light container!
This mod greatly improves the replayability of the game and is playable by anyone who already finished the game once.
For more advanced players, harder difficulties will ask you to progress by using more advanced movement options or
glitches.

This wiki includes lots of information to help install this mod, understand the options for seed generation, and learn
about all the new things included in this mod.
