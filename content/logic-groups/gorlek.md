The Gorlek logic group is for more advanced players. In this difficulty, more precise utilisation of skills are
required. These options are added to the logic:

- Paths that would be possible with [Moki's](/logic-groups/moki) rules but are either not obvious or considered too tricky to execute for [Moki](/logic-groups/moki).
- Connection that are not obvious for [Moki's](/logic-groups/moki) player because the camera isn't showing a pickup.
- Triple jump shard.
- Bashing Grenade projectiles for horizontal movement.
- One damage boost per path, regardless of the amount of damage (taking one damage which reduce your health by 3 would
  be in logic but taking two damages which each reduce your health by 1 is not in logic despite the fact that you took
  less damage).
- [Sword or Hammer aerial combo in order to hover](/tutorials/movement/weapon-movement).
- [Sword or Hammer up attack for extra height](/tutorials/movement/weapon-movement).
- [Bow to go through darkness in Depths](/tutorials/movement/light-sources).

The logic expects you to have found Regenerate to enter Woods, Pools, Depths, Baur, Wastes and Willow but unlike in
[Moki](/logic-groups/moki), there are no HP requirements to enter them in Gorlek.
Regenerate is still expected for boss fights, arenas and combat shrines.
