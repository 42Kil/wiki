The Gorlek logic group is for more advanced players. In this difficulty, more precise utilisation of skills are
required. These options are added to the logic:

- Paths that would be possible with Moki's rules but are either not obvious or too tricky to execute for Moki target
  players
- Connection that are not obvious for Moki's player because the camera isn't showing a pickup
- Triple jump for movement, by using the Triple Jump shard
- Bashing Grenade's projectile for horizontal movement
- One damage boost per path, regardless of the amount of damage (taking one damage which reduce your health by 3 would
  be in logic but taking two damages which each reduce your health by 1 is not in logic despite the fact that you took
  less damage)
- Use sword or hammer aerial combo in order to hover
- Use sword or hammer up attack for extra height
- Bow to go through darkness in Depths

The logic expects you to have found Regenerate to enter Woods, Pools, Depths, Baur, Wastes and Willow but unlike in
Moki, there is no HP requirement to enter these areas in Gorlek. Regenerate is still expected for boss fights, arenas
and combat shrines.
