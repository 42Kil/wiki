Logic groups are a collection of paths which dictate what skills you need in order to access new items.
You can view them as a difficulty setting.
Glitched is a bit peculiar as it enables paths which use glitches defined in other logic groups you choose.

Below is a list of all the logic groups.
Click on one of the links below to learn what is required from the player in order to progress in each logic group.
