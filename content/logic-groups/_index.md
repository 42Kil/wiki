Logic groups are a collection of paths which dictate what skills you need in order to access new items. You can
view them as a difficulty setting. Glitched is a bit particular because it enables paths which use glitches from the
logic group you chose.

Below is a list of all the logic groups. Click on one of the links below to learn what is required from the player
in order to play in each logic group.
