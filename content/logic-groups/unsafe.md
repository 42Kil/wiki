The unsafe [logic group](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Logic-groups) is meant for paths which have not been sorted in any difficulty group. The only rule to put a path in unsafe is that the path is not following the rules of the other groups. Here is a non-exhaustive list of things that can be required in unsafe:
* A path that requires more than one damage boost
* Using grenade or sentry to [redirect projectiles](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Projectile-redirection)
* Using bash to move enemies around
* [Bash glide](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Bash-glide)
* [Dash ramp](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Dash-ramp)
* Sentry, Flash, Spike, Blaze, Shuriken for movement
* [Grenade Jumps](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Grenade-jumps), [weapon jumps](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Weapon-jumps), [sword pogo](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Sword-pogo), [glide jumps](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Glide-jump) and [launch boost](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Launch-boost) for movement
* Aerial [sentry jumps](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Sentry-jump)
* Grenade to go through darkness in Depths

Unsafe logic is also removing all requirement in order to enter Woods, Pools, Depths, Baur, Wastes and Willow while [Gorlek](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Gorlek) requires Regenerate and [Moki](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Moki) requires Regenerate and between 4.5 and 6.5 HP.
