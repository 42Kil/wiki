Glitched a [logic group](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Logic-groups) which is not meant to be activated alone. Glitched paths are adding glitches from the logic groups you selected (except for [Moki](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Moki) since there isn't any glitches in Moki). This part will go through all glitches that are added to the logic in each difficulties.
