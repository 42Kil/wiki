Paths are dictating what skills you need in order to access new items. Default, Advanced and Unsafe can be viewed as difficulty settings while the other ones are enabling unique paths within the difficulty you selected.

Each difficulty have their own rules which dictates what the randomizer might want you to do. One important thing to know is that when each difficulty includes all the paths from the previous difficulty as well. So, for example, when playing in the Advanced difficulty the randomizer will chose paths from both Default and Advanced as intended progression.

## Default

This difficulty is designed for players who have finished the game at least once. A seed in this difficulty does not require any particular knowledge as long as you know how to use Ori's skillset. The logic can ask you to use these skills, individually or in combination:

- Double jump, grapple, dash, water dash, burrow and launch for movement
- Bash for movement and redirection of projectiles
- Bashing Grenade's projectile for vertical movement
- Grenade to melt ice, change the state in Baur and activating lanterns
- Flap for activating the soups in Baur, changing the state in Baur, collecting items under leaves pile and activating wind current
- Glide for both horizontal movement and gliding in wind current
- Flash to go through darkness in Depths
- Hammer or Spear to break breakable floors and ceilings

In this difficulty, the logic expects you to have found Regenerate and have enough HP to enter Woods, Pools, Depths, Baur, Wastes and Willow. Woods, Pools, Depths and Baur require at least 4.5 HP, Wastes requires at least 5.5 HP and Willow requires 6.5 HP. Regenerate is also expected for combat shrines, arenas and boss fights.

## Advanced

The Advanced difficulty is designed for more advanced players. In this difficulty, more precise utilisation of skills are required. These options are added to the logic:

- Paths that would be possible with the Default difficulty's rules but are either not obvious or considered too tricky to execute for this difficulty.
- Connection that are not obvious to Default difficulty's players because the camera isn't showing a pickup.
- Using the Triple Jump shard.
- Bashing Grenade projectiles for horizontal movement.
- One damage boost per path, regardless of the amount of damage (taking one damage which reduce your health by 3 would
  be in logic but taking two damages which each reduce your health by 1 is not in logic despite the fact that you took
  less damage).
- [Sword or Hammer aerial combo in order to hover](/tutorials/movement/weapon-movement).
- [Sword or Hammer up attack for extra height](/tutorials/movement/weapon-movement).
- [Bow to go through darkness in Depths](/tutorials/movement/light-sources).

The logic expects you to have found Regenerate to enter Woods, Pools, Depths, Baur, Wastes and Willow but unlike in Default, there are no HP requirements to enter them in Advanced.
Regenerate is still expected for boss fights, arenas and combat shrines.

## Unsafe

The unsafe difficulty is meant for paths which have not been sorted in any difficulty group, either because they are too hard for the currently designed difficulties or because they aren't following the rules of the other difficulty. Here is a non-exhaustive list of things that can be required in unsafe:
- A path that requires more than one damage boost
- Using Deflector, Grenade or Sentry to [redirect projectiles](/tutorials/movement/projectile-redirection)
- Using Bash to move enemies around
- [Bash glide](/tutorials/movement/bash-glide)
- [Dash ramp](/tutorials/movement/dash-ramp)
- Sentry, Flash, Spike, Blaze, Shuriken for movement
- [Grenade Jumps](/tutorials/movement/grenade-jumps)
- [Weapon jumps](/tutorials/movement/weapon-jumps)
- [Sword pogo](/tutorials/movement/sword-pogo)
- [Glide jumps](/tutorials/movement/glide-jumps)
- Aerial [sentry jumps](/tutorials/movement/sentry-jumps)
- [Grenade to go through darkness in Depths](/tutorials/movement/light-sources)

Unsafe logic is also removing all requirement from the Default and Advanced difficulties in order to enter Woods, Pools, Depths, Baur, Wastes and Willow.

## Glitches

All the other paths options are related to glitches and will only be added in logic if you are playing in the difficulty which enable them or in the difficulty above.
- [Sword Sentry Jump](/tutorials/movement/sentry-jumps) is a glitch which let you get a lot of height by combining Sword and Sentry. This path add grounded sentry jumps using Sword in Advanced and above.
- [Hammer Sentry Jump](/tutorials/movement/sentry-jumps) is a glitch which let you get a lot of height by combining Hammer and Sentry. This path add grounded sentry jumps using Hammer in Advanced and above.
- [Shuriken Break](/tutorials/movement/wall-break#Shuriken) is a way to break wall from the wrong side by clipping shuriken into walls. This path add them in Advanced and above.
- [Sentry Break](/tutorials/movement/wall-break#Sentry) is a way to break wall from the wrong side by using Sentry. This path add them in Unsafe.
- [Spear Break](/tutorials/movement/wall-break#Spear) is a way to break small wall from the wrong side by clipping Spear into walls. This path add them in Unsafe.
- [Hammer Break](/tutorials/movement/wall-break#Shuriken) is a way to break wall from the wrong side by using Hammer. This path add them in Unsafe.
- [Sentry Burn](/tutorials/movement/sentry-as-a-fire-source) is using Sentry as a way to activate lanterns and melting ice. This path add them in Advanced and above.
- [Remove Kill Plane](/tutorials/location/feeding-ground-skip) is a way to disable the kill plane in Feeding Grond, which let you access Weeping Ridge without collecting the wisps. This path add them in Advanced and above.
