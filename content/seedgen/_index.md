title: Seed Genenation
---

A seed is one particular placement of items in the game. For Will of the Wisps, that information is stored in a .wotwr file which you can generate using the seed generator. You can access it either though the [randomizer Launcher](/features/launcher) or on the Internet [here](https://wotw.orirando.com/seedgen). There is a bunch of options but don't worry, this page will go through each of them.
