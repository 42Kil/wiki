Presets are prebuild general options which you can use safely in order to generate seeds. Once you selected the presets you want to use, click on the Apply Presets button in order to add the related options to the settings you selected. By holding Ctrl, the Apply Presets button will change for Override Presets, clicking on it will override your previous settings by the one from the presets you selected.

Here is a quick description of each presets:
* QOL apply the following [headers](/seedgen/headers): Skippable Cutscenes, Spawn Tuley, No Branch, Autoplants, Progress Helper and Teleport Refills. These are just quality of life improvement which greatly reduces the time you'll spend in cutscenes and dialogues. Tuley also spawn from the begining while you would normaly need to do he Wellspring Escape in order for Tuley to appear in Glades.
* Moki select the [Moki](/seedgen/paths#moki) difficulty, the same headers as QOL plus these headers: Teleporters, Vanilla Opher Upgrades, Black Market, Spawn with Sword and the headers related to the [hints](/features/hints) feature: Key Hints, Zone Hints and Teleporter Zone Hints. This is the recommended settings for players who finished the game at least once.
* Gorlek select the [Gorlek](/seedgen/paths#gorlek) difficulty, the same [headers](/seedgen/headers) as QOL plus these headers: Teleporters, Opher Upgrades, Black Market, Key Hints and Zone Hints. This is the recommended settings for more advanced players who know a bit more tricks.
* Glitches enables all paths which use glitches. Since [Moki](/seedgen/paths#moki) is a glitchless difficulty, you are required to play in the [Gorlek difficulty](/seedgen/paths#gorlek) or above in order to enable these paths. Sword and Hammer [sentry jumps](/tutorials/movement/sentry-jumps), [breaking walls from the wrong side](/tutorials/movement/wall-break), [Sentry burn](/tutorials/movement/sentry-as-a-fire-source) and [Remove kill plane](/tutorials/location/feeding-ground-skip#after-cat-and-mouse) will be added to the options the randomizer could expects from you. 
* Random Spawn select the Better Random Spawn header which removes some doors which you can only open from one side in order to make random spawn a better experience. It also changes your starting point for a random one, chosen between every Teleporters of the game.
