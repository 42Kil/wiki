Presets are prebuild general options which you can use safely in order to generate seeds. Once you selected the presets you want to use, click on the Apply Presets button. This will override your previous settings. If you want to add those presets to the settings you already chose for yourself, hold Ctrl which will change the Apply Presets button to Merge Presets.

Here is a quick description of each presets:
* QOL apply the following headers: Skippable Cutscenes, Spawn Tuley, No Branch, Autoplants. Just quality of life improvement which greatly reduces the time you'll spend in cutscenes and dialogues.
* Hints apply the following headers: Zone Hints, Key Hints. This enable the [hints](/features/hints) feature.
* Moki select the [Default](/seedgen/paths#Default) difficulty, the same headers as QOL and Hints plus these headers: Teleporters, Opher Upgrades, Black Market, Spawn with Sword, Progress Helper. This is the recommended settings for players who finished the game at least once.
* Gorlek select the [Advanced](/seedgen/paths#Advanced) difficulty, the same headers as QOL and Hints plus these headers: Teleporters, Opher Upgrades, Black Market, Progress Helper. This is the recommended settings for more advanced players who know a bit more tricks. Check the [Paths](/seedgen/paths#Advanced) page to learn what the randomizer might expects when playing with these settings.
* Glitches enables all paths which use glitches. Glitches requires to play in the [Advanced difficulty](/seedgen/paths#Advanced) or above. Sword and Hammer [sentry jumps](/tutorials/movement/sentry-jumps), [breaking walls from the wrong side](/tutorials/movement/wall-break), [Sentry burn](/tutorials/movementsentry-as-a-fire-source) and [Remove kill plane](/tutorials/location/feeding-ground-skip) will be added to the tools the randomizer could expects from you. 
* Random Spawn select the [Advanced](/seedgen/paths#Advanced) difficulty, apply the same headers as QOL and Hints plus the Teleporters, Opher Upgrades, Black Market, Progress Helper and Better Random Spawn header. This add teleporters to the item pool and remove some doors which you can only oppen from one side in order to make random spawn a better experience.
