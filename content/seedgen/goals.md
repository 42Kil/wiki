Goal modes are restrictions which prevent you from entering the final Willow room before you have completed your objective. If you attempt to enter Shriek’s room before completing all goals, your current goal progress will appear on screen instead. However, if you have tried to enter this room before completing your goals, the warp will unlock so you don’t have to travel there again. 
You can press [Alt+P](/features/special-commands) to check your progress on goal modes.

## All Trees 
In this mode, you will have to visit all 14 ancestral trees and collect their pickups. These trees are the 12 skills trees located in Marsh, Howl's Den, Kwolok’s Hollow, Wellspring, Wastes, Pools, Reach, Depths, and Weeping Ridge plus the 2 Ancestral Light trees located in Glades and above Burrows. If you enabled the Progress Helper [header](/seedgen/headers) during your seed generation, pressing Ctrl+Alt+1 will also show a list of which trees you already collected and which one you still need to collect.

## All Wisps 
All Wisps adds the requirement to collect all the wisps, which are located to their normal location. These wisps are the Voice (from Kwolok in Kwolok’s Hollow), Memory (from finishing the Reach escape), Eyes (from defeating Mora in Depths), Strength (from defeating Kwolok in Pools), Heart (from finishing the Worm's escape in Wastes). If you enabled the Progress Helper [header](/seedgen/headers) during your seed generation, pressing Ctrl+Alt+2 will also show a list of which wisps you already collected and which one you still need to collect.

## All Quests 
All Quests adds the requirement to finish every quest in the game. This includes all main quests but also every side quest including Hand to Hand and Rebuilding the Glades. You can view your quest progress on the map screen. If you enabled the Progress Helper [header](/seedgen/headers) during your seed generation, pressing Ctrl+Alt+3 will also show a list of every quests you need to complete with a short description of the quest itself. The completed quest are also marked as completed in the list.

## World Tour 
World Tour adds one pickup called a [relic](/features/new-items) in some areas. You need to collect the relic in every zone that has one. The number of relics vary from one seed to another. You can tell if a zone has a relic by pressing [Alt+P](/features/special-commands) or opening your map. If the name of an area is red, it means you have already collected its relic. Orange text indicates the area you are currently in (if you haven’t collected its relic).
