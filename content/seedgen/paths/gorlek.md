Gorlek is a difficulty which you can enable from the [Paths tab](/seedgen/paths) of the [Seed Generator](/seedgen). It's the difficulty above [Moki](/seedgen/paths/moki) and is designed for more advanced players. In this difficulty, more precise utilisation of skills are required. These options are added to the logic:

## Glichless

- Paths that would be possible with the Moki difficulty's rules but are either not obvious or considered too tricky to execute for this difficulty.
- Connection that are not obvious to Moki difficulty's players because the camera isn't making it clear you can take a specific path.
- Using the Triple Jump shard.
- Bashing Grenade projectiles for horizontal movement.
- One damage boost per path, regardless of the amount of damage (taking one damage which reduce your health by 3 would be in logic but taking two damages which each reduce your health by 1 is not in logic despite the fact that you took less damage).
- [Sword or Hammer aerial combo in order to hover](/tutorials/movement/weapon-movement#hover).
- [Sword or Hammer up attack for extra height](/tutorials/movement/weapon-movement#up-slash).
- [Bow to go through darkness in Depths](/tutorials/area-specific/light-sources#bow).

The logic expects you to have found Regenerate to enter Woods, Pools, Depths, Baur, Wastes and Willow but unlike in Moki, there are no HP requirements to enter them in Gorlek.
Regenerate is still expected for boss fights, arenas and combat shrines.

## Glitches

If you activate the Glitches preset or if you select the corresponding options in the Paths settings, these glitches will be added in logic:

- [Sword Sentry Jump](/tutorials/movement/sentry-jumps) is a glitch which let you get a lot of height by combining Sword and Sentry. Only grounded sentry jumps are added in logic.
- [Hammer Sentry Jump](/tutorials/movement/sentry-jumps) is a glitch which let you get a lot of height by combining Hammer and Sentry. Only grounded sentry jumps are added in logic.
- [Shuriken Break](/tutorials/misc/wall-break#shuriken) is a way to break wall from the wrong side by clipping Shuriken through walls.
- [Sentry Burn](/tutorials/area-specific/sentry-as-a-fire-source) is using Sentry as a way to activate lanterns and melting ice.
- [Remove Kill Plane](/tutorials/sequence-breaks/feeding-ground-skip#after-cat-and-mouse) is a way to disable the kill plane in Feeding Grond, which let you access Weeping Ridge without collecting the wisps.
