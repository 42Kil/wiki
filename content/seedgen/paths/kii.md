Kii is a difficulty you can enable from the [Paths tab](/seedgen/paths) of the [Seed Generator](/seedgen). It is the difficulty above [Gorlek](/seedgen/paths/gorlek) and is designed for more advanced and experienced players. Currently, Kii paths have not been validated and some are still missing, so use with caution! In this difficulty, even more precise utilisations of skills are required, as well as some energy weapons for movement. These options are added to the logic:

## Glitchless

- Using the Deflector shard to deflect projectiles with Sword
- [Bash Gliding](/tutorials/movement/bash-glide) as well as extending the Bash Glide with Double Jump or Glide.
- Using Sword attacks for [aerial resets](/tutorials/movement/aerial-reset) as well as [Sword pogos](/tutorials/movement/sword-pogo).
- Using ceilings to refresh your Launch or Dash.
- Using Blaze, Flash, Sentry, Shuriken, or Spear for extended horizontal [energy weapon moevemnt](/tutorials/movement/weapon-energy-movement).
- Swimming through clear dirty water is in logic, as well as using Water Dash to take less damage.
- Unlimited damage boosts as long as you have enough health.
- Combining horizontal Sword or Hammer swings with an upslash for more precise [weapon movement](/tutorials/movement/weapon-movement).
- Coyote Dash is a way to dash over a cliff and being able to jump right after. This allows for more horizontal movement.

## Glitches

So far no glitches have been added to Kii.
