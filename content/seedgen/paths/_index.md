When generating a seed, the [Seed Generator](/seedgen) will ensure you can always finish the game by placing every progression items on a pickup you will be able to reach. What we call a path is what skills do you need in order to reach a pickup. Each options in the Paths tab of the Seed Generator is a collection of path which can be toggleabled.

## Difficulty

The first kind of paths are difficulties. Each difficulty have its own guideline which dictates what kind of game mecanics the randomizer might expect from you. At the moment, there is three defined difficulties: Moki, Gorlek and Unsafe.

- [Moki](/seedgen/paths/moki) is the easiest difficulty within the randomizer. It only requires using game mechanics the base game teaches you.
- [Gorlek](/seedgen/paths/gorlek) is the difficulty just above it, adding easy to learn game mechanics.
- Although [Unsafe](/seedgen/paths/unsafe) is defined as a difficulty, it doesn't have any guidelines; it's simply a collection of paths which don't respect the guideline of the other difficulty.

Each difficulty also include every paths from previous difficulties, which means every Moki paths are included in the Gorlek difficulty. You can learn more about what the game can expect from you when playing in a difficulty by reading their respective pages.

The second kind of paths are glitches. All difficulties are glitchless by default but you can activate different glitches within these difficulties by selecting the corresponding options in the Paths tab of the Seed Generator.
