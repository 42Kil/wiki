Moki is a difficulty setting which you can chose from the [Paths tab](/seedgen/paths) of the [Seed Generator](/seedgen). It is designed for players who have finished the game at least once. A seed in this difficulty does not require any particular knowledge as long as you know how to use Ori's skillset. The logic can ask you to use these skills, individually or in combination:

- Double jump, grapple, dash, water dash, burrow and launch for movement
- Bash for movement and redirection of projectiles
- Bashing Grenade's projectile for vertical movement
- Grenade to melt ice, change the furnace's state in Baur and activating lanterns
- Flap for activating the soups in Baur, changing the furnace's state in Baur, collecting items under leaves pile and activating wind current
- Glide for both horizontal movement and gliding in wind current
- Flash to go through darkness in Depths
- Hammer or Spear to break breakable floors and ceilings

In this difficulty, the logic expects you to have found Regenerate and have enough heath to enter Woods, Pools, Depths, Baur, Wastes and Willow. Woods, Pools, Depths and Baur require at least 4.5 total health, Wastes requires at least 5.5 total health and Willow requires 6.5 total health. Regenerate is also expected for combat shrines and boss fights.
