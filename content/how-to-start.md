title: How to start
---

After [installing the randomizer](/installation), you can start `Ori and the Will of the Wisps Randomizer.exe` which will open a [Launcher](/features/launcher) from where you will be able to do everything you need in order to play the randomizer.

Firstly, you need to get a .wotwr file. These files contain the necessary information for your randomized playthrough, like the content of each item. You can generate these files yourself by
using the seed generator integrated into the launcher. You can find instructions on how to use the seed generator [here](https://wotw.orirando.com/seedgen).

For beginners, we recommend to play with the Moki preset and the All Wisps goal. You can choose to disable All Wisps which is
a [goal mode](/seedgen/goals) preventing you from entering the last Willow room before you collected all 5 wisps.

After you get your first .wotwr file, you want to double click on it. It should ask you which program you want to use in
order to open this type of file. Choose to browse for more apps on your computer and search the file WotwRando.exe which
is located in your randomizer installation folder. Once you have associated .wotwr files with the randomizer executor,
you should not have to do this again and simply double clicking on a .wotwr will launch the randomizer.

The randomizer will then launch Ori and the Will of the Wisps. If it takes too long, the randomizer will fail to launch
but the vanilla game will most likely launch itself nonetheless so make sure Steam is already opened before launching
the randomizer.

When you reach the main menu, you can try to press [Alt+L](/features/special-commands) which should display a textbox
with some information about the seed. If nothing appeared, the randomizer failed to inject itself into the game so you will
need to close the game and open your .wotwr file again.

Once the randomizer launches successfully, you simply need to start playing! It is recommended to play on a new save file
because the randomizer will also affect save files made with the base game. If you ever feel lost when playing a seed,
you can open your map and use the [In Logic filter](/features/logic-helper) which will show you every item you can collect with the skills you have.
You can also read the [paths section of the seed generation](/seedgen/paths) to learn more about what the randomizer might want you to do. The
community is also able to help so donâ€™t hesitate to join
the [Ori speedrunning Discord](https://discord.com/invite/aSz79M4) or
the [Ori randomizer development Discord](https://discord.gg/Ahwh4Na) if you need help with something!
