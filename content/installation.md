## Prerequisites

The OriWotw Randomizer requires the latest version of the game on PC (either windows store or steam is
fine).


## Download

Download the lastest `WotwRandoSetup.exe` from [this page](https://github.com/ori-rando/build/releases). Launch this file to
install the randomizer. Remember where you installed it, since you will be launching the mod from this folder.


Because the randomizer is working by injecting its own functionalities in the base game, anti-virus tend to view it as a malware.
You might need to whitelist the folder in which you installed the randomizer so you anti-virus ins't preventing it from launching and installing.

## Steam

Since the randomizer needs to launch Ori and the Will of the Wisps, it needs to know where your steam installation
folder is. If you installed Steam in a non-default location, the randomizer installer will ask you this path. You can
change the Steam path later in your [settings](/features/settings) if needed.


## Windows Store

The randomizer should automatically detect that you have the Windows store version of the game and prompt
you to install the randomizer for it. If it does not, after installing, you can open [the settings](/features/settings) by
either clicking the Settings button or launching RandoSettings.exe from the randomizer installation folder. Look for
the 'Use Windows Store' option.


## After Installation

Check out the [getting started](/how-to-start) page for suggestions on how to generate your first
seed.
