If you unequip Sentry, Blaze or Flash a bit after using them you will get a bigger hop than usual. This will also remove all negatives effect of using these abilities as a movement option, mainly allowing you to wall jump right after using them. You can equip your ability again at any time after releasing your weapon wheel once.

You can use the weapon wheel as a pause buffer. You want to unequip your ability when Ori starts to spread out after they rolled into a ball. Sentry and Blaze will still consume energy even if you cancel it but doing it with Flash won't use any energy (you still need energy in order to activate Flash in the first place).

You can also chain them together to gain a lot of height. Everytime you close your weapon wheel, you won't be able to use your ability for a bit of time so make sure to re-equip it as soon as possible.

This is also possible to use the [same technique with Launch](/tutorials/movement/advanced-launch-tech#launch-swap), which is much more powerful.
