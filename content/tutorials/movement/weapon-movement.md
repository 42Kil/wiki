## Hover

Using Sword or Hammer aerial combo lets you hover. Simply spam your attack button until the aerial combo is over.
Starting a second aerial combo after the first one won’t give you any hover effect. However, with Sword, you can finish your aerial combo by an up slash to hover a bit longer.
With Hammer, you need to start with an up slash before starting your horizontal combo if you want to benefit from it.

## Up slash

When doing an up slash, Ori gains a bit of height. This can be used to reach higher platforms. Hammer’s up slash gets more height than Sword’s up slash.
If you try to do a second up slash before touching the ground, you will not gain any height from it.
