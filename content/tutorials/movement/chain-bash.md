When you bash something, you can cancel the momentum it gives you in order to bash the same thing again. This can be used in order to gain height in order to access pickups.

## Glide

If you keep holding Glide while bashing downward, you will cancel the momentum of your bash. If you bash as soon as the thing enter your bash range again, you will snap to it which gives you a bit of height. You can keep bashing in order to gain height.

## Double jump

Just after releasing a downward bash, you can use your double jump in order to cancel the momentum from your bash. If you do so, you will be able to bash again the thing you bashed, giving you more height.
