You can get more height than usual when jumping on a bounce pad and using some skills.

## Grenade

If you keep holding a grenade before and after jumping on a bounce pad, you will go much higher than usual. You can cancel your grenade by pressing jump before releasing your grenade input, which will refill your energy.

## Hammer

If you do a upslash with hammer and you activate the bounce pad before the end of the animation, you will jump higher than usual.

## Sword

If you do a upslash with sword a bit before activating the bounce pad, you will jump higher than usual. The input is really precise. If you do it too late, you will cancel the momentum from the bounce pad.
