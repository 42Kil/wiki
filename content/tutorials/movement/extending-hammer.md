It is possible to extend the momentum you get from some movement options with Hammer by using a horizontal hammer slash in the opposite direction from the one Ori is facing. Usually used in combination with [Aerial Hammer Sentry Jumps](/tutorials/movement/sentry-jumps#aerial-sentry-jumps) or [Hammer Jumps](/tutorials/movement/hammer-jumps), you can also use it in order to extend momentum from bounce pad and poles.

You can only extend your momentum by using your hammer while you are still ascending.
