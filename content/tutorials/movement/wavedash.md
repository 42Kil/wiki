One of the way for getting a lot of horizontal speed is wavedashes. In order to perform it, you need dash, a wall and another ability. In order to perform a wavedash, you want to dash towards a wall and then hold both the opposite direction and your other ability. The wall can also be other element, like a life flower, since the important part is having the animation where Ori stick themself to a wall.

The further you are from the wall, the easier it will be to get the ability+direction timing but your wavedash will give more speed if you are close to the wall. It's recommended to [bind](/features/keybinds) the direction and your ability together in order to perform it more easily.

## Regenerate

Wavedashes are most commonly performed with Regenerate because it gives the most speed.

## Blaze

Another solution is to use Blaze. Blaze's wavedashes give less speed but can be used in the air while Regenerate's wavedashes can only be performed grounded.
