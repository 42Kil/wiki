If you have Grapple, canceling a grenade  in the air before bashing something and then holding grenade right after releasing a bash will prevent Ori from losing bash's speed. This can be use in order to get a lot of height or go really fast in one direction.
You can't bash your own grenade in order to setup this trick since pressing grenade after your bash will result in your last grenade exploding rather than Ori charging a grenade.
