When doing a down attack with Sword on an enemy, you will get a pogo jump which gives you a bit of height. Since you are hitting an enemy with your sword, this also [resets your aerial movement](/tutorials/movement/aerial-reset). You need to touch the ground or a wall in order to refresh your pogo.
