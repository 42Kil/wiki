When you bash something, Ori gets a boost of speed which slowly disappears.
But it is actually possible to preserve that momentum by releasing directional inputs after you released your bash.
That momentum wonâ€™t decrease until you touch the ground so you can preserve it longer by either using the feather to glide, aerial jumps or a combination of the two.
