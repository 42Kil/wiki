When you bash something, Ori gets a boost of speed which slowly disappears. But it is actually possible to preserve that momentum by releasing directional inputs after you released your bash.

That momentum wonâ€™t decrease until you touch the ground so you can preserve it longer by either using the feather to glide, aerial jumps or a combination of the two. Hammer and Sword up slashes as well as Shuriken and Flap also preserve the glide effect, making you go further. You can also use [Pause Floats](/tutorials/movement/pause-float) in order to preserve the glide effect.
