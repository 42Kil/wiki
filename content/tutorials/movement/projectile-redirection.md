Changing the direction of a projectile lets you break walls that can not be broken otherwise. Even if it is usually done by bashing a projectile, there are other options for it.

The first one is the shard deflector which lets you change the direction of a projectile by hitting it with Sword or Hammer.

The less obvious options are Grenade and Sentry: when they explode they will blast off the projectile, changing its direction.
You can make Grenade explode by either pressing your Grenade button while there is already a Grenade on screen or by launching it into the ground or an enemy.
Sentry will explode when it runs out. Sentrys area of effect is much smaller than Grenade so you will need to be much more precise.
