When in the air, you have multiple movement options: double jump, dash and launch. After using each once, you can not use them again before you reset it. The most common ways to reset them are touching ground, walls or bashing something.

Itâ€™s more situational but burrowing into something, gliding in wind current, using grapple or passing through portal gates reset your aerial movement as well.

Using launch also resets your double jump and dash so you can use a second aerial dash if you dash then launch and dash again.

Sword is really useful in that regard too: when you hit something with your sword, you will get your launch, double jump and dash back.

Some weird geometry in ceilings can also reset your launch and dash when you touch them.
