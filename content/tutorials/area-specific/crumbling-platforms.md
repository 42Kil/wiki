In wastes, there is sand platforms you can burrow through which disappears once you touch it. The way they reappear can seem a bit random but it's they actually aren't based on a timer but will reappear once you touch the ground again.

This can be abused in order to get the Last Stand shard without needing any skills by simply wall jumping on the purple wall.
