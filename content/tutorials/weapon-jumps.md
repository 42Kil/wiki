Weapon jumps let you get more height from your double jump than usual. You can do them with both Sword or Hammer.

## Sword jumps

If you need a bit more height from your double jump, you might want to do some sword jumps. To do them, while in the air, start by a horizontal sword slash and cancel it by a jump. Keep holding your jump and input a second horizontal slash. If you have multiple aerial jumps, you can input it again to chain them together.

## Hammer jumps

Hammer jumps are a great movement tool because they give you a lot of height. To do a hammer jump, start by a horizontal attack and cancel it by a jump. Keep holding your jump and input a second horizontal slash. If you have multiple aerial jumps, you can input it again to chain them together.
