When you bash something, Ori gets a boost of speed which slowly disappears. But it is actually possible to preserve that speed by releasing directional inputs after you released your bash. That speed wonâ€™t decrease until you touch the ground so you can preserve it longer by either using the feather to glide or by using your aerial jumps.
