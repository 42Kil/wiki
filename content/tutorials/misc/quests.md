## Randomizer Quests

The All Quests Goal Mode requires you to complete 17 quests in total.  
Unless you enable the No Quests [header](/seedgen/headers), the steps of these quests will also hold items.  
If you enable the Progress Helper [header](/seedgen/headers), you can use the [Custom Wheel](/features/custom-wheel) in order to see which quests you have completed and what the next steps for each quest are.

In detail, the quests require you to:

**The Silent Teeth**: Complete the Wellspring Escape, then return to Kwolok in his Hollow.

**Beneath Shifting Sands**: Complete the Windswept Ruins Escape to gain Seir

**Lost in Paradise**: Complete the Kwolok Fight in Luma Pools to gain the Strength of the Forest

**Breaking the Mould**: Complete the Mora Fight in Mouldwood Depths to gain the Eyes of the Forest

**The Highest Reach**: Complete the Baur's Reach Mountain Escape to gain the Memory of the Forest

**The Missing Key**: Collect the Keystone from the Cave left of Regenerate tree and bring it to Tokk waiting nearby

**Into the Burrows**: Collect the Tablet from inside Midnight Burrows and bring it to Tokk waiting outside

**Lost Compass**: Collect the Needle in the middle room of Wellspring and bring it to Tokk waiting outside

**A Little Braver**: Collect the Howl Fang to the right of the Howl Fight and bring it to the Moki waiting nearby

**Family Reunion**: Build the first huts with Grom's help in Wellspring Glades and talk to the father Moki near Grom to collect a key. Use it near the entrance of Silent Woods to open his family's house, then return to the father Moki.

**The Tree Keeper**: In preparation, complete the Wellspring escape so Tuley is present in Wellspring Glades (gardener NPC to the right). Talk to the Kii near the entrance of Silent Woods. Bring the branch they give you to Tuley, then return to the Kii. Bring the seed they give you to Tuley and plant it.  
*Note*: Using the Quality-of-Life [preset](/seedgen/presets) shortens this quest: Through the combination of the Tuley Spawn, No Branch and Autoplants [headers](/seedgen/headers), the only step left is talking to the Kii in Woods, which will complete the quest.

**A Diamond in the Rough**: Collect the Raw Shard by Burrowing near a Shovel in the early parts of Windswept Wastes and bring it to Twillen.

**Into the Darkness**: Remove the thorns and clear the cave entrance with Grom's help in Glades. Collect the Acorn from inside the dark cave and bring it to the Moki waiting outside.

**Kwolok's Wisdom**: Complete the Kwolok fight in Luma Pools. Talk to the Moki in the early parts of Luma Pool and bring their Amulet to the Altar near where you first met Kwolok in his Hollow. If you talked to the Moki before doing the Kwolok fight, you need to speak again with them before you can bring the amulet to the Alter in Kwolok's Hollow.

**Regrowing the Glades**: In preparation, complete the Wellspring escape so Tuley is present in Wellspring Glades. Collect the seeds from the Wellspring, Silent Woods, Baur's Reach, Mouldwood Depths, Luma Pools and Windswept Wastes, bring them to Tuley and plant them.  
*Note*: Using the Quality-of-Life [preset](/seedgen/presets) shortens this quest: Through the combination of the Tuley Spawn and Autoplants [headers](/seedgen/headers), you only need to collect all the seeds, which will complete the quest.
