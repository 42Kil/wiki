There is a pickup at the left of where the Wellspring Escape starts which is commonly known as the Wellpring escape revisit pickup because you normally need to do the escape before getting it.

But it's possible to go above the trigger of the escape, letting you get that pickup before doing the escape. There is a lot of ways to do this but they are all doing the same thing: get enough height in order to pass above the trigger (which is basically the purple rectangle in the clip) and get the pickup by going left then dropping through the semi-solid.
