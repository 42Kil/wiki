At the lower right heart in Willow, you need to break a corruption which makes a boulder fall which you then need to avoid by going all the way back at the start of the room. Once it's done, you can go back up and break the Heart.

You can actually pass under the falling boulder before it start rolling, making you able to skip the Indiana Jones like sequence.
