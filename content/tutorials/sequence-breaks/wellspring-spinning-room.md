## Skipping the room

The Spinning room in Wellspring can be skipped which saves a lot of time. At the right of that room, if you haven't pulled any lever, you can go through a gap which let you go to the the next room without doing the puzzle.

## Clean Water

If you have Clean Water when entering this room, some lasers will be disabled which make doing the room easier.
