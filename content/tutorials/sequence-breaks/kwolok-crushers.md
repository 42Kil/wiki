In order to reach the Kwolok's fight in Luma Pools, you are supposed to use Water Dash in order to pass through some crushers but it's actually possible to pass them through normal swimming

## Glitching the crushers

If you can reach the checkpoint in the keystone room above, you can glitch out the crushers. For this, simply activate that checkpoints and let the cruchers stomp you. Once you returned there, the crushers won't be at their normal position so you can swim above them to avoid triggering them. You can glitch them out one by one if you aren't confortable with this trick.

## Swiming through the crushers

It's possible to avoid the crushers before they stomp you. By doing so, you can swim through them without dying.
