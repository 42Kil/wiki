title: Custom Wheel
---

The randomizer has multiple [special commands](/features/special-commands) related to the randomizer itself. Most of them are accessible from a Custom Wheel which works just like the weapon wheel from the vanilla game. You can open this wheel by pressing V on your keyboard or holding both shoulder buttons on a controller (you can [rebind](/features/keybinds) this action to whatever you want).

[Headers](/seedgen/headers) can also add custom functionalities in this wheel, such as the Progress Helper header which is adding a way to see at any moment which trees, quests and wisps you already have collected and which one you still need to collect.
