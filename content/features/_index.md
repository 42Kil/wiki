The main function of this randomizer is shuffling all the item locations.
That means it’s completely possible to collect a spirit light container but get the double jump skill instead.
Likewise, Skill Trees don’t always give you a skill, so you might find a Gorlek Ore when activating the Bash Skill Tree.

The item placement however is not completely random: there is an algorithm or logic to the chaos.
This ensures that every playthrough is beatable by placing each progression item at a location you will be able to reach.
For more information, you can read the [logic guide](/logic-groups).
This mod also adds other functionality to the game. Click on the links below to learn more about them.
