Goal modes are restrictions which prevent you from entering the final boss fight before you have completed your objective. If you attempt to enter Shriek’s room before completing all goals, your current goal progress will appear on screen instead. However, if you have tried to enter this room before completing your goals, the warp will unlock so you don’t have to travel there again. 
You can press [Alt+P](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Randomizer's-special-commands) to check your progress on goal modes.

## Force Trees 
In this mode, you will have to visit all 14 ancestral trees and collect their pickups. These trees are the 12 skills trees located in Marsh, Howl's Den, Kwolok’s Hollow, Wellspring, Wastes, Pools, Reach, Depths, and Weeping Ridge plus the 2 Ancestral Light trees located in Glades and above Burrows

## Force Wisps 
Force Wisps adds the requirement to collect all the wisps. These wisps are the Voice (from Kwolok in Kwolok’s Hollow), the 3 wisps from Depths, Reach and Pools plus the final one from Wastes.

## Force Quests 
Force Quests adds the requirement to finish every quest in the game. This includes all main quests but also every side quest including Hand to Hand and Rebuilding the Glades. You can view your quest progress on the map screen.

## World Tour 
World Tour adds one pickup called a [relic](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/New-items) in some areas. You need to collect the relic in every zone that has one. The number of relics can vary greatly from one seed to another. You can tell if a zone has a relic by pressing [Alt+P](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Randomizer's-special-commands) or opening your map. If the name of an area is red, it means you have already collected its relic. Orange text indicates the area you are currently in (if you haven’t collected its relic).
