The randomizer adds a few new commands you can activate by pressing multiple keys at the same time. Many of these are disabled in race seeds.

* Alt + P: Shows your progress in the seed (number of pickup collected, progress in [goals](/seedgen/goals) and [hints](/features/hints)
* Alt + L: Reloads the current seed.
* Alt + T: Shows the textbox of the last item you collected
* Ctrl + Alt + D: Toggle Debug Menu
* Ctrl + Alt + 4: Unlock Spoilers
* Ctrl + Alt + 5: Toggle TPCheat (makes every pickup a teleporter)
* Ctrl + Alt + L: Toggles Cursor Lock
* Ctrl + Alt + C: Show current coordinates
* Ctrl + Alt + N: Toggles showing location names in spoiler filter (hold L in map)

By using the Progress Helper [header](/seedgen/headers), you will also add three special commands which track which trees, wisps and quests you completed so far:
* Ctrl + Alt + 1: Show which trees you already collected and which one you still need to collect
* Ctrl + Alt + 2: Show which wisps you already collected and which one you still need to collect
* Ctrl + Alt + 3: Show which quests you already completed. Unfinished quests will show up as well with a short description of the quest

You can rebind these commands by modifying the rando_binds.ahk file (it gets generated the first time you launch the randomizer).
