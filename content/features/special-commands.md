The randomizer adds a few new commands you can activate by pressing multiple keys at the same time. Many of these are disabled in race seeds.

* Alt + P: Shows your progress in the seed (number of pickup collected, progress in [goals](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Goal-modes) and [hints](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Hints))
* Alt + L: Reloads the current seed.
* Alt + T: Shows the textbox of the last item you collected
* Ctrl + Alt + D: Toggle Debug Menu
* Ctrl + Alt + 4: Unlock Spoilers
* Ctrl + Alt + 5: Toggle TPCheat (makes every pickup a teleporter)
* Ctrl + Alt + L: Toggles Cursor Lock
* Ctrl + Alt + C: Show current coordinates
* Ctrl + Alt + N: Toggles showing location names in spoiler filter (hold L in map)

You can rebind these commands by modifying the rando_binds.ahk file (it gets generated the first time you launch the randomizer).
