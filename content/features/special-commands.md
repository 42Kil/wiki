The randomizer adds a few new commands you can activate by pressing multiple keys at the same time. Many of these are disabled in race seeds.

* Alt + P: Shows your progress in the seed (number of pickup collected, progress in [goals](/seedgen/goals) and [hints](/features/hints)).
* Alt + L: Reloads the current seed.
* Alt + T: Shows the textbox of the last item you collected
* Alt + C: Teleports you to end of the game if you already completed your goal. Currently, this is only used by the 3-line bingo utility [header](/seedgen/headers).
* Alt + /: Exit the randomizer instantly
* Ctrl + Alt + D: Toggle Debug Controls
* Ctrl + Alt + L: Toggles Cursor Lock
* Ctrl + Alt + C: Show current coordinates
* Ctrl + Alt + N: Toggles showing location names in spoiler filter (hold L in map)

Ctrl + Alt + 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are also special commands but they don't do anything by default. When playing plandos or by using some heaers, these commands can be used to display additional functionalities. When using the Progress Helper [header](/seedgen/headers) you will have accept to these different information by using these binds:
* Ctrl + Alt + 1: Show which trees you already collected and which one you still need to collect
* Ctrl + Alt + 2: Show which wisps you already collected and which one you still need to collect
* Ctrl + Alt + 3: Show which quests you already completed. Unfinished quests will show up as well with a short description of the quest

You can rebind these commands by modifying the rando_binds.ahk file (it gets generated the first time you launch the randomizer).
