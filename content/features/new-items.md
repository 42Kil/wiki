The items you can found in the randomizer are usually items from the base game like keystones, health upgrades or skills but the randomizer also adds some new items to the mix if you enable some [headers](/seedgen/headers) during the [seed generation](/seedgen):

* Extra Double Jump: if you already found Double Jump, this pickup will give you a bonus jump for extra mobility.
* Extra Air Dash: if you already found Dash, this pickup will give you another dash in the air for extra mobility.
* Health Regeneration: regenerates your health over time.
* Energy Regeneration: regenerates your energy over time.
* Rapid Hammer: increases hammer’s swing speed.
* Rapid Sword: increases sword’s swing speed.
* Weapon Efficiency: reduces the energy cost of the corresponding weapon by half.

There are also some other new items that are not classified as Bonus Items:
* Teleporters: make you able to teleport to the corresponding spirit well, even if you never went near it. You need to enable the Teleporters [header](/seedgen/headers) when generating a seed to add them in the item pool.
* Clean Water: make the water swimmable without taking any damage. In the base game this is done by completing the Wellspring Escape but in the randomizer you have to found this specific item.
* Black Market Keystones: Out of keystones? No problem, buy as many as you need from Opher. Price increases for every keystone bought. You need to enable the Black Market [header](/seedgen/headers) in order to enable that behaviour.
* Relic: special items you need to collect in the World Tour [goal mode](/seedgen/goals).
