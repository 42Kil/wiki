When watching the credits, the game will share statistics on your performance in each area.

For every area in the game, the randomizer will share how many pickups you got from that area, how many time you died and how much time you spend here aswell as showing your PPM. PPM is a ratio between how many pickups you collected and how much time you spend in the area. It stands for Pickups Per Minute. The higher it gets, the faster you are collecting pickups.
