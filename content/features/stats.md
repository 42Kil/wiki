In the Stats tab of the Launcher, you can see the statistics of your current seed. You need to load a savefile in order to see this information.

For each area, the randomizer will share how many pickups you got, how many times you died and how much time you spent there aswell as showing your Pickups Per Minute (PPM). PPM is a ratio between how many pickups you collected and how much time you spend in the area. The higher it gets, the faster you are collecting pickups.

You'll also be able to see other statistics such as the time lost to death, the number of time you used a teleporter and your peak PPM. Under these stats you can find a timeline showing you when you got which skill.

The game will also share some of those statistics when rolling the credits.
