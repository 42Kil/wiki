On the ingame map, you can cycle thourgh different filters which show or hide different element. The randomizer adds a new filter called In Logic.

This filter shows every pickup you are able to reach with your skillset by following the [Paths](/seedgen/paths) you selected during the [seed generation](/seedgen). You are guaranteed to find the next intended progression by collecting one of the pickup showing on that filter. Once you found a new skill, the In Logic filter will update automatically and every pickup you can reach with this newly aquired skill will appear on this filter.
