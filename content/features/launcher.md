You can access every randomizer's features through the launcher. In order to open it, simply open `Ori and the Will of the Wisps Randomizer.exe` from your randomizer's installation folder.

From there, you have multiple tabs for launching a seed, [generating a seed](/seedgen), accessing your [settings](/features/settings) or playing in [multiplayer](/features/multiplayer).

## Home

This is the main page of the launcher. From here, you can read through the patch notes of every version as well as launching your latest seed. If a new release is available, the launcher will inform you and let you decide if you want to update before starting your game.

From here, you can also create a [multiplayer](/features/multiplayer) game by using the New Game button, access the wiki and other important location:

* Open seeds directory: Open in your file explorer the folder in which all the seeds you generated are stored.
* Open randomizer directory: Open the directory in which the randomizer itself is located (which is different from the folder of the launcher).
* Create support bundle: Whenever something unexpected such as a crash happens, you can create a support bundle in which every important files for the developpers of the randomizer are stored. Share this with a dev to help them figuring out the bug.
* GitHub: Open the Ori Rando's organization page which list every repositories related to the randomizer
* Discord: An invitation to the Ori speedrun Discord to nerd out with the Ori players. Really useful to found players to play with or if you need help with anything!

## Game

This is where you can settup multiplayer games. To access this tab you need to be logged in, which is using [Discord](https://discord.com/). There is multiple way to play with other players which are all explained on the [multiplayer](/features/multiplayer) page.

## Seed Generator

From this tab, you can generate seed by using a local [seed generator](/seedgen). A seed is a file containing informations about where every items are located and you need one in order to play the randomizer.
