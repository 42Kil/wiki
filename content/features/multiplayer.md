The randomizer also adds the possibility to play with other players! To do so, you first want to [generate a seed](/seedgen) with the Enable Netcode option enabled in the Generator tab.

When you generated the seed, you will get a little pop-in with a button which let you download the seed, one to get a sharable link which you will have to share with the other players and a Go To Game button.

Once you click to this last button, you will be redirected to [this website](https://wotw.orirando.com/) where you will need to login. The connection uses [Discord](https://discord.com/) so please download it if you don't already have it. When you loaded up the seed, press [Alt+P](/features/special-commands). After the general seed information, you should get a message mentionning that you are connected. If it is not working, you might have disabled the netcode in the randomizer [settings](/features/settings).

## Co-op
In Co-op, every player play on the same seed and share pickups so if a player from your team collects a pickup you will get that item aswell and the pickup will disappear from your game. This mode also shares game states so for example if your teammate opened the second room of wellspring, it will be opened for you as well.

To generate a Co-op seed, when enabling the Netcode option, more options should show up. Select the Co-op option from the last dropdown and then [generate your seed](/seedgen) like any other seed. Then, download the seed and use the share button in order to let the other players access the pop-in that just appears and click on the Go To Game button. When you are on that page, either create a new team or join an already existing one. Every players which are on the same team will share pickups.

## Multiworld
Multiworld is a cooperative mode where every players have different seeds but, in you seed, you will found items for both you and other players. This is different from a normal co-op where when someone found Bash, it gives it to every player in your team. In multiworld, there is one copy of Bash for every players and founding Bash for another player won't give your own Bash. Your next logical progression can be placed in another player's seed which means you can be blocked for a bit while waiting for someone else to find you another skill.

To generate a Multiworld seed, when enabling the Netcode option, more options should show up. In the Multiworld player names input field, write every players' names (press enter every time you finished entering one name) which should also set the last dropdown to the Multiworld setting. Then, [generate your seed](/seedgen) like any other seed and download the seed with your name. Next, use the share button in order to let the other players access the pop-in that just appears which will let them download their own seed and click on the Go To Game button. When you are on that page, either create a new team or join an already existing one.

## Bingo
Bingo is a mode which gives you a board with 25 objectives to complete. Your goal is to form lines with your completed goals. It's recommanded to use the 3-Line Bingo utilities [header](/seedgen/headers) which let you press Alt+C when you completed at least 3 lines in order to start rolling the credits without having to kill Shriek. The randomizer automaticaly track your progress towards goals and will automaticaly claim goals you completed. Goals can vary from collecting pickups or trees to completing quests or doing specific actions like completing fight rooms and rolling the snowball in Reach.

In order to generate a bingo seed, you first want to [generate a seed](/seedgen) with the Netcode option enabled. The seed generator unfortunately don't support the creation of a bingo game yet so you will have to set the last dropdown to the None option and share the generated seed with the other players. Once you did, go to [this website](https://wotw.orirando.com/), login and create one of the 3 variants of Bingo by clicking the corresponding button, share the URL of the page with the other players so they can join your game and click on the Join button on the right.

Bingo have two different variants, which each add a little twist:

### Discovery bingo
If you click on the New Discovery Bingo Game button, you will use a variant of bingo where most goals will be hidden at first. This is the same as a normal bingo except that only 2 goals will be displayed from the 25 goals. When you complete one goal, the goal adjacent to the one you finished will be revealed. The autotracker will keep track of your progress towards hidden goals but they won't show up on the grid until you unlock them by completing a goal adjacent to them. When a completed goal is revealed, its adjacent goals will be revealed as well.

### Lockout bingo
If you click on the New Lockout Bingo Game button, you will use a variant of bingo where you can't validate a goal if another player already validated it. Since it's pretty hard to complete lines in this variant, the goal is to have more validated goals than the other players and not to form lines. This is usually played in 1 versus 1 so the first player with 13 completed goals from the 25 available one win the game.
