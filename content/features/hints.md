During the [seed generation](/seedgen), you have the option of enabling different hints through the use of [headers](/seedgen/headers). These are sold by NPCs and provide information on the locations of important skills.

The Zone Hints [header](/seedgen/headers) add hints on Lupo’s map: instead of giving you an item Lupo will give you a hint which tells you how many Key Items are in this area. Woods and Glades hint are sold by Lupo in Glades. Key Items include every skill, plus Clean Water and Water Breath.

The Teleporter Zone Hints [header](/seedgen/headers) add an hint which will tell you how many Teleporters pickup are in the area. Woods and Glades hint are sold by Lupo in Glades. This header is compatible with the Zone Hints headers. If you activate both, Lupo will give you both the Teleporter and the Zone Hint at the same time.

The Key Hints [header](/seedgen/headers) activates 3 different skills, which you can buy at Opher, Twillen and at Lupo in Glades and gives you the zone in which some important skills are located:
* Twilen is selling a hint for Bash and Bow. This hint cost 1500 at first and its price will decrease if you own one of these two items.
* Opher is selling a hint for Clean Water, Glide and Flap instead of selling Water Breath. In order to unlock this hint, you first need to complete Wellspring's escape and then buy it from Opher at 2500 Spirit Light. Like for Lupo’s hint, the price will decrease if you already have some of the skills related to this hint.
* If you speak to Lupo in his house at Glades Lupo will also sell a hint revealing the zones in which you can find Water Dash, Burrow, Grenade, and Flash. The price of this hint starts at 4000 Spirit Light and will decrease if you already own some of these skills.

After buying these hints, you can press [Alt+P](/features/special-commands) or open your map to display them again.
